# GreenRun

### The easiest run to have fun
user story
Sign up and pick from the various mountains in the GreenRun database to have up to date weather conditions and also know where to get the best drinks and food in town. Once users have registered and selected some mountains they will be able to see that information on their profile page. Easily add and remove mountains as you please.


Users should feel invited by the home page and want to sign up with the registration form right there for them. The buttons for all all the routes are prominent enough to allow for easy use among all users.

### tech
Node.js, Express, Handlebars, Gulp, Mongoose, mongoDB, JS, HTML, LESS/CSS

### approach
Came up with the idea for general application. Created the wire frame to visualize the pages and routes.  Created the server, schemas, hbs pages, and controllers to create the flow or the processes. 


### issues
creating a for loop to loop through user mountains and display the proper weather for each location on the profile page.

### unsolved problems
The giant if else statement for cycling throw images for current weather
